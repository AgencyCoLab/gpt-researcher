Look at the singing pints “holding out for a zero” in last year’s St. Patrick’s Day spot or the beer’s most recent film to coincide with the stout’s Premier League sponsorship – a cheeky portrait of how playfulness and community show up wherever you find humanity.\n“A brand is made not just by the people who buy it, but also by the people who know about it,” says John. “I don't buy Guinness. I don't like it.” His honesty prompts a laugh from AMV BBDO chief creative officers Nicholas Hulley and Nadja Lossgott, who work on the beer brand’s advertising.

This resulted in the brand choosing to support pubs financially in their own time of need.It also gave the marketing team a chance to take stock and consider its communications for when the time came for a return to normality.This strategy consisted of four principles: opening up the brand to appeal to more adults and occasions; balancing reach and relevance throughout the year; creating culture as both input and output; and placing even more of an emphasis on its distinctiveness.This would see it lose the ‘Made of More’ brand platform to become more inviting\n\nSource: https://www.lbbonline.com/news/how-creative-heritage-drives-success-for-brands-like-guinness\nTitle: How Creative Heritage Drives Success for Brands like Guinness | LBBOnline\nContent: Part of Guinness’ creative heritage shows up in its products too.
