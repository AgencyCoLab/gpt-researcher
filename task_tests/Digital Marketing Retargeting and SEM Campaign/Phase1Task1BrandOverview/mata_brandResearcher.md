This resulted in the brand choosing to support pubs financially in their own time of need.It also gave the marketing team a chance to take stock and consider its communications for when the time came for a return to normality.This strategy consisted of four principles: opening up the brand to appeal to more adults and occasions; balancing reach and relevance throughout the year; creating culture as both input and output; and placing even more of an emphasis on its distinctiveness.This would see it lose the ‘Made of More’ brand platform to become more inviting\n\nSource: https://creative.salon/articles/features/guinness-brand-effectiveness-amv-bbdo\nTitle: Five Things We Learned… About The Growth of Guinness\nContent: the brand, Guinness increased its prices by between 10 per cent and 16 per cent while continuing to grow.During the St Patrick’s Day campaign to promote Guinness 0.0 in 2023, it was able to increase sales of the non-alcohol variant by 50 per cent, with 150 more pubs selling it permanently, whist also changing attitudes to its c onsumption.
